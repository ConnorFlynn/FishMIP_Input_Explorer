# FishMIP Input Explorer
This repository contains all scripts developed to produce a Shiny app supporting the publication **An Integrated Global-to-Regional Scale Workflow for Simulating Climate Change Impacts on Marine Ecosystems** by Ortega-Cisneros et al.   
  
The FishMIP Input Explorer Shiny app allows regional modelers to explore all environmental variables available in the GFDL-MOM6-COBALT2 model. Climatological maps and monthly weighted time series are presented for all participating FishMIP models. Data used to create plots is available for download via the app.
